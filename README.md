# Deep Learning Facial Recognition (Python)

An end-to-end **facial recognition system** built with a **Siamese neural network**. This project guides you from data collection through model training to real-time verification—all in a Jupyter notebook.

## Overview

This repository implements facial recognition using a Siamese network, capable of learning the similarity between image pairs. It includes steps from capturing your own data to training and verifying identities using your webcam.

## Features

* **Image Collection** – Capture anchor, positive, and negative images via webcam for building training datasets. 
* **Data Preprocessing** – Load, preprocess, and transform images for efficient model training. 
* **Model Training** – Train a Siamese network using TensorFlow to learn distinguishing facial features. 
* **Real-Time Verification** – Use OpenCV to recognize or verify faces captured from webcam in real time. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

* `tensorflow`
* `opencv-python`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`

You can install them with:

````bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
``` :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

##  Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royxlead/deep-learning-facial-recognition-python.git
   cd deep-learning-facial-recognition-python
````

2. **Prepare directories:**

   Make sure you have these directories in place:

   ```
   ├── data/
   │   ├── anchor/
   │   ├── positive/
   │   └── negative/
   └── application_data/
       ├── input_image/
       └── verification_images/
   ```

   * `data/` holds training examples (anchor, positive, negative).
   * `application_data/` is for images used during real-time verification. 

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook deep_learning_facial_recognition.ipynb
   ```

   Follow each cell: collect images, train the model, and test verification. 

4. **Interact via Webcam:**

   * Press `a` to save an **anchor** image.
   * Press `p` to save a **positive** image.
   * Press `q` to exit image collection mode.
   * Press `v` to capture a **verification** image during inference. 

## Notes

* Balance your collected samples across anchor, positive, and negative sets for better training results.
* Paths or directory names in your notebook may need adjusting based on your local setup.
